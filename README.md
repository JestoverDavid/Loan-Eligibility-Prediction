# Loan Eligibility Prediction

This repository contains a project focused on predicting loan eligibility using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze a dataset of loan applications, preprocess the data, and build a model to determine loan eligibility.

## Introduction
The project involves exploring a dataset containing loan application records, performing data preprocessing, and applying machine learning algorithms to predict whether an applicant is eligible for a loan. This repository includes the steps and methodologies used to achieve this goal.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features related to loan applicants, such as applicant income, coapplicant income, loan amount, loan amount term, credit history, and property area.

## Project Structure
- `Loan Eligibility Prediction.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the data analysis, preprocessing, and model building steps.
- `loan-train.csv`: The dataset used for training the model (make sure to add this file to the repository).

## Usage
Clone the repository, open the Jupyter Notebook, and follow the steps outlined to run the analysis and build the predictive model.
